This pipeline was developed to assembly whole chloroplast genomes from genome shotgun data from Illumina.  Any high-throughput sequencing data should work, but we have mostly tested with Illumina.

The assembly pipeline is capable of producing full chloroplast genomes (with proper orientation) under certain circumstances.  We are exploring how to optimize this.

The coverage analysis pipeline will check to see if your assembly has
